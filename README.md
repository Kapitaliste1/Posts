# Posts

Hello, 

This project is a simple test, we have an API that returns a list of posts and we can access the details page for each of them. 
In the post detail page, we can rotate the business card that is shown to reveal more information from the back. 

We are using our own Swift Package Manager module to deal with the CoreData related work, here is the link of the repo: https://github.com/Kapitaliste1/CoreDataPackage.git

You just need to update the swift package modules to the latest version and you'll be good to go.
